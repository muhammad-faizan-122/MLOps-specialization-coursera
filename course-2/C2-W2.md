## **Title:Wrapper Methods for Feature Selection**

- **Definition and Functionality:**
  - Wrapper methods are supervised feature selection techniques that use a model's performance as a measure of feature effectiveness.
  - These methods iteratively evaluate subsets of features using a model and select the subset that yields the best performance.
  - Different wrapper methods include forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination.

- **Forward Selection:**
  - Begins with a single feature and iteratively adds features one at a time based on their impact on model performance.
  - Features are gradually added to the subset until no further improvement in performance is observed.

- **Backward Elimination:**
  - Starts with all features and evaluates the model's performance when removing each feature individually.
  - Features are eliminated one at a time until no further improvement in performance is achieved.

- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):**
  - Selects a model for evaluating feature importance and specifies the desired number of features.
  - Features are ranked by importance based on the model's evaluation, and the least important features are discarded.
  - This process continues until the desired number of features is reached.

- **Implementation of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):**
  - Utilizes a random forest classifier as the model due to its ability to provide feature importance.
  - Features are scaled and then passed through the RFE process to select the top features.
  - The selected features are then used for evaluation, resulting in the final performance metrics.

- **Evaluation and Comparison:**
  - Recursive feature elimination (RFE) yielded a subset of 20 features, achieving comparable or better performance compared to other methods.
  - Performance metrics such as accuracy, AUC score, precision, recall, and F1 score were evaluated and found to be satisfactory with the selected features.

**Conclusion:**
Wrapper methods offer a powerful approach to feature selection by iteratively evaluating subsets of features based on their impact on model performance. By leveraging the predictive capabilities of machine learning models, these methods help identify the most relevant features for improving model accuracy and efficiency. Recursive feature elimination, in particular, stands out as a robust technique for selecting a subset of features that contribute significantly to model performance.

## **Embedded Methods for Feature Selection**

- **Definition and Functionality:**
  - Embedded methods are supervised feature selection techniques that are inherent to the model being used.
  - These methods include L1 or L2 regularization and feature importance, both of which are closely tied to the characteristics of the model.
  - L1 regularization assigns weights to each feature and eliminates less important features by setting their weights to zero or near-zero.
  - Feature importance assigns scores to features based on their contribution to the model's performance.

- **Implementation with SKLearn:**
  - In SKLearn, the `Feature Importance` class is built into tree-based models such as `RandomForestClassifier`.
  - The `feature_importances_` property of the model provides the feature importances.
  - `SelectFromModel` can be used to select features based on their importances, effectively reducing the feature set.

- **Implementation in Code:**
  - Define a function to calculate feature importance using a tree-based model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`) on the training data.
  - Extract the feature importances and select the top features based on their importance scores.
  - Use `SelectFromModel` to select features from the model and drop the other features from the feature vector.

- **Evaluation and Comparison:**
  - By selecting features based on importance, the feature set can be reduced while maintaining reasonable performance.
  - Performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC, precision, recall, and F1 score may vary slightly with reduced features, but the impact is manageable.
  - Consideration should be given to the balance between performance metrics and resource efficiency when deciding on the number of features to select.

**Conclusion:**
Embedded methods offer a model-centric approach to feature selection by leveraging characteristics inherent to the model being used. By considering feature importance or applying regularization techniques, less important features can be discarded, resulting in a reduced feature set without compromising model performance significantly. However, the choice between performance metrics and resource efficiency should be carefully considered when selecting the optimal number of features. Overall, embedded methods provide a valuable tool for feature selection in machine learning workflows.
