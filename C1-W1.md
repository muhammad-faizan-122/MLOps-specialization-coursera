## Title: Machine Learning Project Lifecycle: Speech Recognition Example**

**Introduction:**
- Deep learning has significantly improved speech recognition, enabling applications like voice search on smart speakers and smartphones.
- While research focuses on improving speech models, building a valuable production deployment involves various steps in the machine learning project lifecycle.

**1. Scoping:**
- Defining the project involves choosing a specific area like speech recognition for voice search.
- Metrics to consider include accuracy, latency, throughput, and resource estimates.
- Emphasis on estimating project timeline and resource requirements.

**2. Data Collection:**
- Define data, establish baselines, and address labeling challenges.
- Consistent labeling is crucial, illustrated with an example audio clip.
- Data definition questions, such as handling silence and volume normalization, are essential considerations.
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the **Data Collection** phase with an example:

- **For instance**
    In the context of a speech recognition system, the data collection phase is a critical step where you gather the audio samples that will be used to train and evaluate your machine learning model.

    **Define Data:**
    For a speech recognition application, you need to define the characteristics of your data. This includes determining the context in which the speech will occur. For instance, if you're building a voice search system, your data might consist of various people speaking commands or queries.

    **Establish Baselines:**
    Establishing baselines involves creating a benchmark or reference point for your data. This could involve understanding the baseline level of background noise, variations in speaking styles, and any other factors that might affect the quality of the speech data.

    **Address Labeling Challenges:**
    Labeling audio data consistently is a common challenge in speech recognition. Let's consider an example audio clip:

    *Audio Clip:* "Um, today's weather."

    Now, imagine this audio clip being transcribed by different individuals:

    1. **Transcription 1:** "Um today's whether"
    2. **Transcription 2:** "Um today's weather"
    3. **Transcription 3:** "Um today's ... noise"

    Each transcription is valid, but inconsistency can pose a problem for machine learning. Therefore, addressing labeling challenges involves standardizing the labeling process to ensure uniformity across the dataset. This might involve defining conventions for handling background noise, accents, or other factors that can vary in speech.

    **Data Definition Questions:**
    During this phase, you'll encounter several questions related to data processing:

    * **Handling Silence:** How much silence should be included before and after each audio clip? Defining the duration of silence ensures uniformity in the dataset.

    * **Volume Normalization:** Speakers may vary in their loudness. Questions arise about how to normalize volume across different audio clips to prevent biases in the model.

    These data definition questions are crucial as they impact the quality and consistency of your dataset, which, in turn, affects the performance of your speech recognition model.

    In summary, the Data Collection phase for a speech recognition system involves not only gathering audio samples but also defining, standardizing, and addressing challenges to create a high-quality dataset for training and evaluation.

- The importance of focusing on both code and data for effective model training.
- Contrasting research-oriented approaches that fix data and vary code with a product-oriented approach that holds code fixed and optimizes data.

## Title: Challenges and Considerations in Deploying Machine Learning Models**

- **Introduction:**
  - Exciting moment in a machine learning project is deployment.
  - Two major challenges in deployment: 
    - Machine learning/Statistical issues
    - Software engineering issues.

- **Machine Learning/Statistical Challenges:**
  - **Concept Drift and Data Drift:**
    - Concept drift: Changes in the desired mapping from x to y (e.g., COVID-19 affecting credit card fraud systems).
    - Data drift: Changes in the input distribution x (e.g., shifts in language, new device models).
    - Importance of recognizing and managing changes for sustained model performance.
    - example:(
        1. **Concept Drift:**
        - If the model is trained for English language and is later used in a scenario where people are speaking in Urdu, that would indeed be an example of concept drift. The fundamental nature of the task (language) has changed.

        2. **Data Drift:**
        - If the model is trained on English data with a specific accent, and later there is a shift in the accent of the speakers, that would be an example of data drift. The data distribution (accent in this case) within the same language has changed.

        So, in your example:
        - **Concept Drift:** Switching from English to Urdu (change in the fundamental nature of the task).
        - **Data Drift:** Changing accents within English (shift in the data distribution of the same language)
        )
- **Examples of Concept Drift and Data Drift:**
  - Manufacturing example: Lighting changes affecting smartphone scratch detection.
