### Lecture Notes: "Structured Prompting for Language Models"

**Title: Introduction to Structured Prompting for Language Models**

**Key Points:**

1. **Challenges with Language Models:**
   - Language models play a significant role in software development.
   - Most applications involve extracting structured data from language models, often in the form of JSON.
   - Existing methods of working with language models can lead to code that is hard to maintain and prone to errors.

2. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Language models need to be backward compatible with existing systems.
   - The goal is to integrate language models with current systems via APIs or schemas without major code changes.

3. **Introduction to OpenAI Function Calling:**
   - OpenAI function calls help define JSON schemas for desired outputs.
   - Improves the reliability of parsing JSON by allowing users to specify the desired structure.

4. **Issues with String-based Approaches:**
   - Processing input and integrating with existing systems often involves working with strings.
   - Lack of type checking, syntax highlighting, and linting makes code error-prone and challenging to maintain.

5. **Introduction to Pantic:**
   - Pantic is introduced as a library for data model validation, similar to data classes.
   - Powered by Typing, Pantic provides excellent model and field validation.
   - Outputs JSON schema for communication with OpenAI function calling.

6. **Improving Code Quality with Pantic:**
   - Define objects using Pantic for better validation and cleaner code.
   - Enables autocomplete and spellchecking, improving code quality and reducing errors.

7. **Introduction to Instructor:**
   - Instructor is a library to enhance the usability of OpenAI function calling.
   - Patch completion API with Instructor, define Pantic objects, and set them as response models.

8. **Benefits of Using Structured Prompting:**
   - Cleaner code, better validation, and improved code quality.
   - Integrates prompt, data, and behavior in one JSON schema.

9. **Applications and Examples:**
   - Extracting structured outputs for various applications.
   - Planning queries, creating knowledge graphs, and handling question-answering tasks.
   - Emphasizes the importance of structured prompting for more productive development.

10. **Advanced Applications:**
    - Examples include planning complex queries, extracting knowledge graphs, and handling question-answering with structured outputs.
    - Demonstrates the flexibility of structured prompting for various use cases.

11. **Future Possibilities:**
    - Explores potential advancements in structured outputs, including multimodal applications.
    - Envisions a world where language models can handle diverse tasks with structured prompts.

12. **Conclusion:**
    - Structured prompting enhances the capabilities of language models.
    - Encourages developers to explore and experiment with new possibilities in the structured output space.
